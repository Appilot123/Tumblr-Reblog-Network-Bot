<h1 align="center">Tumblr Reblog Network Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:
This project is a stealth Tumblr automation bot built to simulate coordinated engagement via mass reblogs. Designed to mimic natural Tumblr user behavior, it enables users to boost the visibility of a post by having multiple accounts continuously reblog it across the platform. This method is commonly used in viral loops, niche promotions, or private content networks.

The bot bypasses detection by Tumblrâ€™s moderation system using a blend of randomized actions, proxy rotation, and advanced browser fingerprinting. Inspired by underground discussions and social exchange tactics, this bot provides a robust and scalable alternative to manual reposting or paid promo services.

## Core Features:
- **Human-Like Reblogging:** Uses scroll delays, hover actions, and varied reblog intervals to mimic real Tumblr users.
- **High Obfuscation:** Leverages browser isolation via GoLogin or Multilogin and residential proxies to evade detection.
- **Automated Credit Farming:** Integrates with social exchange platforms (e.g., FollowLike.net) to collect and spend credits for likes/reblogs.
